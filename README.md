# GTuber_Demo
Made as template for people to create their own VTuber app with the Godot Engine.

![gif of the demo in action](https://github.com/PinkWisp/GTuber_Demo/blob/main/Screenshots/GTuber%20Demo.gif)

I use Godot 4.4 NET for the Darnoman's GlobalInput addon (it lets hotkeys work from the desktop or other programs).
Currently used to calibrate the draw area for the display tablet.

I THINK if you download everything but the GlobalInput stuff it should work on the standard version.

Feel free to contact me for help. I will try my best, I am still very new to coding.

### "I have no idea what Godot is but I want to try it" Guide
1. Install Godot 4.4 Net from the offical site: https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.4-stable/
2. Download the code (scroll up and click the green button)
3. Launch Godot and import GTuber_Demo
4. Install whatever .NET file are required and restart GTuber_Demo : https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download
5. Import your own assets and create your own VTuber App!!
   An over simplification but I commented my code the best I could to help new people along.
